IMPORTANT:
The thickness of the PCB should be 1mm, and FR4 should be used as a material.

We encourage you to share this project with other ham radio operators to help them monitor the spectrum of the HF band
along with their SDR receivers. 

We hope our contribution helps the ham radio community build low cost and effective pan adapters for their rigs.
